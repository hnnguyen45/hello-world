# hello-world
This is a test and tutorial.

Hi, my name is Hieu Nguyen. I am using github for the first time and new into this world of coding and programming. 
I had many challenges and struggles with learning new languages and also trying to figure out something simple to something 
complex. I hope to improve and boost my confidence.
